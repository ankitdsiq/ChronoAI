  4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
    • This section provides answers to common questions about Timechronos,   covering general information, billing, and technical aspects.

    • What is Timechronos?
        ◦ Timechronos is a next-generation SaaS platform designed to simplify, automate, and enhance timetracking, resource utilization, and project billability. Unlike traditional tools focused solely on time entry,Timechronos aims to transform timesheet management into a strategic asset for modern businessesranging from freelancers to mid-sized teams.clients and projects, and approve timesheets, ultimately enhancing efficiency and productivity.

    • How secure is my data?
        ◦ At Timechronos, data security is our top priority. We employ industry-standard security measures, including data encryption (both in transit and at rest), secure server infrastructure, regular security audits, and strict access controls. Your data is protected against unauthorized access, loss, and misuse, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

    • What devices can I use Timechronos on?
        ◦ Timechronos is a web-based application, meaning you can access it from any device with a modern web browser and an internet connection. This includes desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. For the best experience, we recommend using updated versions of popular browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari.

    • "How do we track time for a specific customer in Timechronos?
        ◦  Time is logged against Tasks, which belong to Projects, and Projects are tied to Clients. Therefore, to track time for a specific customer, you ensure tasks are correctly linked to their projects, which are correctly linked to their client. The "Time Logging" point in the "Complete Integrated Flow" explicitly mentions this.

    • "Can a project be shared across multiple clients?"
        ◦ The "Conceptual Relationship" under "Projects" clearly states: "each Project is explicitly linked to only one Client."

    • "Where do I find the individual work items assigned to my team for a big initiative?"
        ◦ "big initiatives" are Projects, and within Projects, the "individual work items" are Tasks. The "Tasks" section details their role in workload management for individual Employees, while the "Projects" section describes them as containers for tasks.

    • "If a client has several different types of work, how do we categorize them?"
        ◦ This implies creating separate Projects for each "type of work" for that client. The "Projects" section defines them as "distinct, organized body of work or a specific initiative" for a client.
        ◦ Example: For instance, imagine your client, "GlobalTech Solutions," has contracted your company for a variety of services. Instead of lumping all work under one generic "GlobalTech" project, you would create separate, focused projects like these:
    • Client: GlobalTech Solutions
        ◦ Project 1: GlobalTech - Website Redesign
            ▪ (This project would encompass all tasks related to the visual and functional overhaul of their main website.)
        ◦ Project 2: GlobalTech - Mobile App Development
            ▪ (This project would cover everything from design to coding and testing for their new mobile application.)
        ◦ Project 3: GlobalTech - Annual IT Consulting Retainer
            ▪ (This ongoing project would capture all general consulting hours and smaller support tasks provided throughout the year.)
        ◦ Project 4: GlobalTech - Q3 Marketing Campaign
            ▪ (This project would focus specifically on the deliverables and tasks for their third-quarter marketing efforts.)
Each of these projects is a distinct, organized body of work or a specific initiative for GlobalTech Solutions. This approach ensures:
    • Clearer Tracking: You can easily see how many hours are spent on web design versus mobile app development for the same client.
    • Accurate Reporting: Generate specific reports on the profitability and progress of each service type.
    • Better Management: Assign different teams or resources to specific projects, managing them independently while still linking them to the core client relationship.
        ◦ 

    • "Who is responsible for completing tasks?"
        ◦ The "Employees" section explicitly states their core role is "To execute tasks" and that "Employees are assigned to and perform Tasks."

    • "How does Timechronos know who worked on what project?
        ◦ The "Employees" section clarifies that "Employees are assigned to and perform Tasks," and that they "log time against these specific Tasks." Since tasks are linked to projects, this directly connects the employee's work to the project.

    • How is billability calculated?
        ◦ Billability in Timechronos is calculated based on the time employees log against tasks that are designated as 'billable'. When an employee records hours for a task linked to a project, and that task/project is marked as billable, those hours contribute to the total billable hours for the employee, project, and client. This allows for clear tracking and reporting of revenue-generating work.

    •      What are the subscription plans?
        ◦ Timechronos offers various subscription plans tailored to different organizational needs, typically based on the number of active users and included features (e.g., advanced reporting, integrations). For detailed information on our current subscription plans, pricing, and feature sets, please visit the "Pricing" section on our official website or contact our sales team.


    • How do I update my billing information?
        ◦ You can update your billing information, such as credit card details or billing address, directly within your Timechronos account settings. As an Admin, navigate to Settings > Billing & Subscription (or a similar path). Follow the prompts to securely update your payment details. If you encounter any issues, please contact our customer support team for assistance.

    • What are the system requirements?
        ◦ Timechronos is a cloud-based application, so specific local hardware requirements are minimal. You will need:
        ◦ Operating System: Any modern operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, iOS).
        ◦ Web Browser: A modern, up-to-date web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari. Ensure JavaScript is enabled.
        ◦ Internet Connection: A stable and reliable internet connection for optimal performance.
        ◦ Hardware: A computer or device with sufficient RAM (at least 4GB recommended) and processing power to run your chosen web browser smoothly.

    • “For whom Timechronos is?”

     5. Understanding the Timechronos Hierarchy:- 
    • This section outlines the fundamental data model and relationships within Timechronos. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for accurately tracking work, managing time, and generating meaningful reports. Every piece of work, from the highest-level engagement to the smallest daily activity, fits into this logical, interconnected structure, performed by your workforce.

    A. Clients: The Strategic Relationship Layer (The "Who" We Work For)
At the pinnacle of the Timechronos hierarchy are Clients. A client represents the external entity (an organization, company, or individual) for whom your services are performed and for whom billable work is often undertaken. They are the ultimate recipients of our efforts and the primary source of revenue.
    • Core Role: To define the external party that contracts your services.
    • Key Attributes: Name, Email, Code and a description.

    B. Projects: The Organized Work Initiative (The "What" We Deliver for a Client)
Directly linked to clients are Projects. A project is a distinct, organized body of work or a specific initiative undertaken for a designated client. Projects typically have a defined scope, objectives, and planned start and end dates. They act as logical containers for all the detailed work required to achieve a client's specific goals.
    • Core Role: To group and manage all related work for a specific client initiative.
    • Key Attributes: Project Name, Domain (e.g., Web Development, Consulting), Start Date, End Date, associated Client, and Description.
    • Conceptual Relationship: A Client can have one or many Projects. However, each Project is explicitly linked to only one Client. Example: Client "Acme Corp" might have Projects "Website Redesign" and "Q4 Marketing Campaign."

    C. Tasks: The Granular Unit of Execution (The "How" We Do the Work Within a Project)
At the most granular level of the hierarchy are Tasks. A task is a single, actionable unit of work that contributes directly to the completion of a specific project. Employees log their time against these individual tasks, providing detailed insight into daily activities and workload.
    • Core Role: To define specific, actionable steps required to complete a project.
    • Key Attributes: Task Name, Description, Assignee(s), Status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), Priority, Due Date.
    • Conceptual Relationship: A Project is comprised of one or many Tasks. Each Task is always associated with only one Project. Example: The "Website Redesign" Project might include Tasks like "Design Wireframes," "Develop User Authentication," and "Content Migration."

    D. Employees: The Workforce (The "Who" Performs the Work)
Employees are the individuals within your organization who perform the tasks. They are the human element that brings projects to completion and generates billable hours for clients. In Timechronos, employees are assigned to tasks and log their time, providing the critical link between work definition and work execution.
    • Core Role: To execute tasks, log time, and contribute to projects for clients.
    • Key Attributes: First Name, Last Name, Email, Position, and their assigned tasks and projects.
    • Conceptual Relationship: Employees are assigned to and perform Tasks. Employees log time against Tasks. Multiple Employees can work on the same Project by taking on different Tasks within it. Example: John (an Employee) is assigned the "Develop User Authentication" Task, which is part of the "Website Redesign" Project for the "Acme Corp" Client.

    E. The Complete Integrated Flow: Client → Project → Task ← Employee
This logical, interconnected structure forms the backbone of Timechronos, ensuring that every hour logged and every activity performed is organized, attributable, and executed by a defined workforce.
    1. A business relationship is established with a Client.
    2. Specific work Projects are defined for that Client.
    3. Individual actionable Tasks are outlined within each Project.
    4. Employees are assigned to and execute these Tasks.
    5. Employees log their time against these specific Tasks, which in turn roll up to their respective Projects, and ultimately contribute to the overall work done for a Client.
